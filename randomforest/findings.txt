OOB Score Practice

1. With too few data (< 1000), the result slightly varies (oob score moved from 1.0 to 0.98)
2. Even with 3400 data, if samples of a class is too few (< 1000), the result slightly varies (oob score moved from 0.988 to 0.990)
3. Even 4000 data with equal amount for both classes, if they are hardly devided, the result varies (oob score moved from 0.668 to 0.692)
4. Even 4000 data with equal amount for both classes with slightly difficult to devide, the result slightly varies (oob score moved from 0.992 to 0.994)
5. Even 4000 data with equal amount for both classes with highly easy to devide, the result slightly varies (oob score moved from 0.992 to 0.994)

Conclusion: Amount of data (AD), equality of amount of data (EAD), devidablity (D), affect to OOB score. AD and D affect in 0.0x level, EAD affects in 0.00x level. In short, EAD should be cared for OOB scoring.
